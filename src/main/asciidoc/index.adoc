This is documentation for API for getting the anagrams of any word.

Anagram:: An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag-a-ram.

*_Examples_*
....
William Shakespeare = I am a weakish speller
Helmuth Elsner = me run the shell
Computer = mute proc = CPU metro
Visual Studio = loud USA visit = itâ€™s usual void
Wareneingang = gain new range = earn gang wine = eager wanning = aging earn new
....

This RESTful WebService, given a search phrase provided as parameter of the call, returns all the combinations of words that are anagrams of the search phrase.
 
* Letter  case does not matter.
